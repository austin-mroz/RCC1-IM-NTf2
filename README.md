## overview

This repository contains the simulation details and analysis code associated
with the work presented in ["Construction of an organic cage-based porous ionic
liquid using an aminal tying strategy"]().

## simulation setup

### structure and simulation box construction

Here, we describe the structure generation and simulation box construction
workflow; the full simulation box generation procedure and MD simulation protocol
is detailed [here](https://github.com/austin-mroz/RCC1-IM-NTf2/tree/main/simulation),
as well as in the manuscript SI.
The atomistic structure of the [RCC1-IM]6+ cage was generated using the stk
software package.$^1$ Owing to the ionic nature of the cage, the system is
manually atom-typed using a combination of the IL.FF $^{2-5}$ and OPLS-AA $^6$ force 
fields, Figure 1a. The individual LAMMPS input files were generated with the
fftool package.$^7$
The atomistic structure of the [NTf2]- ion from previously reported studies is
used; this structure is described by the IL.FF forcefield,$^{2-5}$ an extension of
the OPLS-AA forcefield parameterized specifically for ionic liquids, Figure 
1b. Starting LAMMPS input files were generated with the fftool software 
package.$^7$
The simulation box is then constructed, Figure 1c. To do this, a single,
charge neutral simulation box featuring 1 cage molecule and 6 ions is generated
using the packmol software package.$^{8,9}$ Then this small simulation box is 
tiled in the x, y, and z directions using moltemplate.$^{10}$ This results in 
the final simulation box consisting of 48 cages and 288 ion molecules.

packed in a single cell at a cage:solvent ratio of 1:6 to maintain charge 
neutrality using packmol.11,12 The single cell is tiled using moltemplate13 to
generate the full simulation box.

### system equilibration procedure

MD simulations were carried out using LAMMPS; the input files were generated 
with the moltemplate software package $^{10}$ in the final simulation box 
construction step. 

To arrive at a reasonable starting geometry, the lattice generated by 
moltemplate (Figure 1c) was slowly relaxed. A potential cutoff of 12 Å is 
used; the partial charges from the IL.FF and OPLS-AA force fields are used to 
calculate the electrostatic interactions. An NPT ensemble was used with a 
Nose-Hoover barostat and thermostat. Simulations were performed at 363 K and 1
atm. Four simulations were performed at increasing time steps: i) 50 fs 
simulation with a time step of 0.001 fs, ii) 1000 fs simulation with a timestep 
of 0.01 fs, iii) 5000 fs with a timestep of 0.1 fs, and iv) 0.9 ns with a 
timestep of 1.0 fs. The simulation box is then thermally annealed using a NVT 
ensemble. Here, a 1 fs timestep and 100 ps runs, the temperature is stepped 
from 600 K to 500 K to 400 K to 363 K. Finally, the simulation box was 
equilibrated for 50 ps using an NPT ensemble and a 1 fs timestep. A production 
run of 10 ns was then performed at 363 K and 1 atm. Figure 2 presents the 
density profile over the 10 ns production run; the density converges to 1.342 
± 0.005 g/cm $^3$.

The density profile for the 10 ns production run was plotted using [`./analysis/plot_density_equilibration_profile.py`](https://github.com/austin-mroz/RCC1-IM-NTf2/tree/main/analysis/plot_density_equilibration_profile.py)

Experimental densities of known NTf2-based ionic liquids featuring cations containing imidazolium motifs were used, as presented by IL distributor, Ionic Liquid Technologies;14 specifically, [EMIM][NTf2], [BMIM][NTf2] and [HMIM][NTf2], Table 1. The density of [RCC1-IM][NTf2]6 equilibrated to 1.342 +/- 0.006 g/cm3. Table 1 details the cationic component of each ionic liquid, the associated density; the density reported for [RCC1-IM][NTf2]6 is calculated from the full liquid simulation. Considering the addition of the cage pores in the PIL, we expect the density to be less than known ionic liquids.

## simulation analysis

Simulation analysis details are presented [here](https://github.com/austin-mroz/RCC1-IM-NTf2/tree/main/analysis)

### radial distribution functions

The radial distribution function (RDF) of several atom pairs is calculated from the 10 ns trajectory, Figure S14. We examine the same atom pairs previously reported for [BMIM][NTf2] simulations.15 The similarities between the RDFs for these two systems suggests that the liquid structure of the [RCC1-IM][NTf2]6 simulation is reasonable. Further, from the cation-anion RDFs, we observe that the imidazolium rings of the [RCC1-IM]6+ cage and the imide of the [NTf2]- ion are close; this is further supported by the reported trajectory of the [NTf2]- counterions in Figure 4b of the main text.
